# AngularJS Demos

This demo uses a local server implemented with Node.js.

To run this,
* install Node.js from http://nodejs.org if not already installed
* enter "node server.js"
* browse http://localhost:3000
* click on "Baseball" and "Hockey" buttons in nav
* scroll the baseball table
* expand and collapse tree nodes in the hockey tree

This uses ui-router which enables a router to update more than one view.
For detail on ui-router see https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router.
